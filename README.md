## 🧐 About <a name="about"></a>

This project was developed as part of a job contest for ZenStreet.ai and received praise for its robust functionality and data handling capabilities. The app allows users to manage events with CRUD functionality, offering flexibility to work directly with a database. While the UI is kept simple, it includes core features such as a calendar interface and notifications.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

To run the project, follow these steps before executing `npm start`. The app requires environment variables, including a MongoDB connection key and a port key.

The app consists of both server and client components, each running on different ports. Run `npm install` inside both the server and client folders.

### Installing

#### Server
1. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install`.
2. Set up a MongoDB connection key.
3. Choose your own port in the configuration.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.

#### Client
1. Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm install`.
2. Ensure that all packages are updated as per the latest syntax (some packages may require updates).
3. Start the client using `npm start`.

## 🚀 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After installing dependencies and setting up environment variables, run both the client and server by navigating to their respective directories and starting them. This will allow you to interact with the application, add events, view them in a calendar, and receive browser notifications.
